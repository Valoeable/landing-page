        <p class="mtext">The man, the myth, the legend, the boss Corgi. His stare is deadly for the foes, but pleasant and encouraging for the crewmembers.</p>
        <p class="mtext">The right hand of the boss(or should I dare say the punching hand), the fearless bodyguard doggo. His bite is as deadly as is stepping on Legos.</p>
        <p class="mtext">The left hand man which handles finances, the smartest boi, accountant doggo. Never uses calculator, that shit is for pussies he once said.</p>
        <p class="mtext">The duo that is feared by many doggo taxpayers, the doggo tax collectors. If you survived their wrath while not paying off a loan from the boss, you got really lucky son.</p>
